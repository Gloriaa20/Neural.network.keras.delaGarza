Neural Network with Keras

📌 This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of a Neural Network using Keras and TensorFlow for solving a classification task. It uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The network is trained to classify these images into one of the 10 possible classes.

🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the MNIST dataset. It uses the Keras API, which runs on top of TensorFlow, to define and train the model. The model is evaluated on a separate test set, and the performance is measured using accuracy.

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the goal is to predict the digit (0-9) in each image.
